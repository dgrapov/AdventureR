You go to high school, and drop out.<br />![image](dropout.png)<br /> You join the army.<br />![image](army.png)<br /> You serve 4 years in Afghanistan and become addicted to heroine and an experimental 'Top secret' government drug. When you get back to the states you become a junkie who suffers daily PTSD induced hallucinations. This makes you perfectly qualified to work for Mcdonalds, inside of a Walmart! <br /> ![image]( mcdonalds3.png )
