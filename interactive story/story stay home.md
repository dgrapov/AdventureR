You go to high school, and drop out.<br />![image](dropout.png)<br /> You stay at home and sponge off your parents.<br />![image](stayhome.png)<br /> You stay at your parents until they start to cramp your style.<br />![image](crampstyle.png)<br /> This forces you to move out and start your own burglary ring.<br />![image](burglary.png)<br /> On your first robbery attempt you try to mug an old lady who is also a Muay Thai kickboxer. She proceeds to kick you in the gut, shattering your spleen following which you pass out from the pain and are arrested. After a brief stay in the hospital, you spend the next 2 years in jail. Upon your release you have to disclose your felon status to future employers and are faced by crippling hospital bills. In desperation you go to work for Mcdonalds, inside of a Walmart! <br /> ![image]( mcdonalds.png )
